    <p>
      Stratus clouds usually have a thin, flat, and long appearance. They are
      uniform grayish clouds that often cover the sky. Usually no precipitation
      falls from stratus clouds, but they may produce a drizzle. They are
      sometimes called &ldquo;high fogs&rdquo; because they are like a thick
      blanket high up in the sky. They usually last from 2 to 6 hours before
      dissipating. Stratus clouds can be composed of water droplets, supercooled
      water droplets, or ice crystals depending environment&rsquo;s temperature.

      <h2>
        How Stratus Clouds are Formed
      </h2>

      <p>
        Stratus clouds form in calm, stable conditions when gentle breezes raise
        cool, moist air over colder land or ocean surfaces. These clouds can
        exist in a variety of thicknesses and are sometimes opaque enough to
        darken days, allowing for little light to pass through. Almost all rain
        is produced from low-level clouds. Stratus clouds produce steady rains,
        and cumulus clouds produce intense, stormy precipitation. They usually
        last from 6 to 12 hours before dissipating. These are low-level clouds,
        found at about 6,000 ft high.

            Thick, dense stratus or stratocumulus clouds producing steady rain
            or snow often are referred to as nimbostratus clouds. In contrast to
            layered, horizontal stratus, cumulus clouds are more cellular in
            nature, have flat bottoms and rounded tops, and grow vertically.
