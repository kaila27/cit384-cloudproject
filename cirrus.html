      <h2>
        How Cirrus Clouds are Formed
      </h2>

      <p>
        The thin and wispy cirrus clouds are made up of ice crystals that come
        from the freezing of supercooled water droplets. These clouds are among
        the highest clouds in the troposphere. They are found at heights of
        greater than 20,000 feet high. They exist where temperautres are below
        -38&deg; Celcius. They are always white in color since they are entirely
        made up of ice crystals. They are found usually during the winter, or
        places with very cold weather. Cirrus clouds are commonly known as
        &ldquo;mare&rsquo;s tails&rdquo; because they are shaped like the tail
        of a horse.

            The difference in clouds depends on the altitude at which they form
            as well as the general atmospheric conditions.
            <em>Cirrus clouds</em> are wispy, veil-like clouds that form in the
            upper troposphere, while cumulus clouds are stacked, dense and
            fluffy, and they form much closer to the ground.
